    <h4>In addition to the 27% of the universe that's believed to be dark matter, a lot more is in the form of dark energy, which makes up about 68% of everything around us (the "normal" matter we all know and love is only 5% of the universe).</h4>

	<p>And like dark matter, we don't know much about dark energy, but the current hypothesis is that it's what's behind the increasing expansion of the universe (whereas dark matter slows it).

	Much of our understanding of dark matter and energy comes from the Cosmic Microwave Background, a snapshot of thermal radiation "soon" (380,000 years) after the Big Bang, when hydrogen atoms were first formed.</p>

    <h4>Dark matter is still a mystery, but we're relying on it to help explain some of the unknowns of our universe â€” cosmologists believe as much as 27% of the universe is dark matter.</h4>

	<p>We're more certain of what dark matter isn't rather than what it is. It's not made of black holes (the light warping that they'd cause isn't present).</p>

	<p>One theory: the dark matter of the universe is made up of primordial black holes.</p>
