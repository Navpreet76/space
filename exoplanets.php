      <h4>This artist’s impression shows exoplanet HD 189733b, as it passes in front of its parent star, called HD 189733A.</h4><p>Hubble’s instruments observed the system in 2010, and in 2011 following a large flare from the star (depicted in the image). Following the flare, Hubble observed the planet’s atmosphere evaporating at a rate of over 1000 tonnes per second.</p>

        <p>In this picture, the surface of the star, which is around 80% the mass of the Sun, is based on observations of the Sun from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.</p>

<h4>The planet HD 189733b was discovered in 2005 and is so close to its star that it is gravitationally "tidally locked", so that one side always faces the star and the other side is always dark.</h4>

<p>Because the planet is only 63 light-years from Earth, a visitor would see many of the same stars we see in our nighttime sky, though the constellation patterns would be different. Our Sun and the nearest star to our Sun, Alpha Centauri, appear as two faint stars near the centre of the image.</p>
 <h4>This illustration shows a "hot Jupiter" planet known as HD 189733b orbiting its star, HD 189733.</h4><p> The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope measured the actual visible light colour of the planet, which is deep blue. This colour is not due to the presence of oceans, but is caused by the effects of a scorching atmosphere where silicate particles melt to make "raindrops" of glass that scatter blue light more than red light.</p>

        <h4>This image shows an artist’s impression of the ten hot Jupiter exoplanets studied by David Sing and his colleagues.</h4>

        <p>The images are to scale with each other. HAT-P-12b, the smallest of them, is approximately the size of Jupiter, while WASP-17b, the largest planet in the sample, is almost twice the size. The planets are also depicted with a variety of different cloud properties.</p>

        <h4>There is almost no information about the colours of the planets available, with the exception of HD 189733b, which became known as the blue planet (heic1312).</h4>
        <p>The hottest planets within the sample are portrayed with a glowing night side. This effect is strongest on WASP-12b, the hottest exoplanet in the sample, but also visible on WASP-19b and WASP-17b. </p><p>It is also known that several of the planets exhibit strong Rayleigh scattering. This effect causes the blue hue of the daytime sky and the reddening of the Sun at sunset on Earth. It is also visible as a blue edge on the planets WASP-6b, HD 189733b, HAT-P-12b, and HD 209458b.</p>
        <h4>The wind patterns shown on these ten planets, which resemble the visible structures on Jupiter, are based on theoretical models</h4>
